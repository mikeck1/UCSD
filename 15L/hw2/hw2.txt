0.  Don't forget: to change the file header! (0 point)

1.  You're taking CSE 12 and the PA is due in 25 minutes, but when you run your
    executable with command: `./cse15`, but you get an error message.

    Which file descriptor should the message be printed with?

stderr

2.  What is the command that shows you the full path of your current working
    directory? (1 point)

pwd

3.  cse15.c

     ```
     1 #include <stdio.h>
     2
     3 int my_abs(int  a) {
     4     if (-a < 0) {
     5         a = -a;
     6     }
     7
     8     return a;
     9 }
    10
    11 int main() {
    12     int input = 0;
    13     int output = 0;
    14
    15     input = -17;
    16     output = my_abs(input);
    17
    18     printf("expected: %d\n", 17);
    19     printf("output: %d\n", output);
    20 }
    ```

    What is the command to debug `cse15.c` using GDB, assuming that the
    corresponding executable is named `cse15`? (1 point)

make
./a.out
gdb a.out

or 
cc -g cse15.c
./a.out


4.  How do you place a breakpoint at function `main`? (1 point)

break main
or
b *main

5.  At some point during debugging, you see the following being printed after
    you typed in "next":

    15     input = -17;

    What will be printed if you enter "print input?" (1 point)

-17

6.  What line will be executed when you type "next"? (1 point)

16

7.  Say you are on this line:

    16     output = my_abs(input);

    What is a command in GDB that brings your debugging INTO 'my_abs()' and
    executes the first line? (1 point)

step

  Now quit GDB.
    After you have fixed the bug in your code, you want to save the output
    printed by your program in order to compare with a reference solution.

    What would you enter in your bash terminal to redirect the output of
    `./cse15` to a file named "my_solution.txt"? (1 point)

./a.out > my_solution.txt

9.  Assume that you have a reference solution file named "ref_solution" that
    contains the expected output of this PA.

    What is the command to help you check whether the `my_solution` and
    `ref_solution` are the same or not? (1 point)

cmp  $ref_solution $my_solution || echo "files are different"

10. Your solution looks perfect. Good job! Now, you are worried your program may
    have memory violations, so there are still more things to check.

    What is a complete command that can help you check for memory issues such
    as memory leaks and invalid memory accesses in your `cse15` executable?
    HINT: The command is not simply `make valgrind`! (1 point)

valgrind --leak-check=full -v ./cse15.c

TURNIN PROCEDURE:

    Inside your `hw2` directory, type in `turnin` and follow the instructions.
    Make sure that you get the confirmation email from Autograder.
